## Features

The **Code Review App** offers a comprehensive set of features to facilitate an effective and streamlined code review process:

### 1. **Multi-Language Support**
   - The app supports four languages: English (En), Slovak (Sk), Spanish (Es), and German (De). Language files are stored in JSON format, making it easy to add or modify languages.

### 2. **Customizable UI**
   - The application uses the `customtkinter` library to provide a modern and customizable user interface, with options to adjust the appearance mode and color theme.

### 3. **Sidebar Menu**
   - The sidebar includes the following options:
     - **Open GitHub:** Quickly access the developer's GitHub page.
     - **Send Email:** Report issues or send feedback directly via a pre-filled email.
     - **Open Settings:** Launch a settings window to configure application preferences.

### 4. **Dynamic Segment Management**
   - Add, delete, and update code review segments dynamically:
     - Each segment allows you to input a range of lines, a detailed description, and categorize the segment as a note, possible problem, or error.
     - The app automatically updates segment numbers when a segment is added or removed.

### 5. **Automatic Date and File Type Selection**
   - The current date is automatically populated in the UI, and users can select the file type from a dropdown menu.

### 6. **PDF Generation**
   - The app generates a detailed PDF report based on the inputted segments:
     - The PDF includes the file name, controller name, date, and all segments with their descriptions and categorizations.
     - The generated PDF is styled with custom fonts and colors to ensure a professional appearance.

### 7. **Logging**
   - Comprehensive logging is implemented throughout the application:
     - Logs are saved in `dat/app.log`.
     - Logs include information on settings loading, UI initialization, segment management, and PDF generation.
     - Error handling with detailed logging ensures easier debugging and maintenance.

### 8. **Built-In Settings Window**
   - Easily modify and save application settings using a dedicated settings window.
   - The settings are loaded and saved automatically to ensure that your preferences persist across sessions.

### 9. **Email Reporting**
   - Quickly report issues or share feedback through an integrated email function, pre-filled with subject and body content based on the selected language.

### 10. **Information Pop-Up**
   - The app provides an information pop-up window that guides users through the process of using the app, including step-by-step instructions.

### 11. **Automatic Segment Creation**
   - The app automatically creates two segments when it starts, allowing users to quickly begin their code review process.

These features make the **Code Review App** a powerful and efficient tool for anyone involved in the code review process, whether individually or in a team setting.
